#################feature ideen 

[] Add by tastenkürzel 


[] keep cut out (z.B. größeres Loch schneiden, verbinder rein, extrateil draufkleben um zu schließen, )

    
[+] planar gizmot
    [] Coupsize --> scale all (z is definition problem)
    [+] bmesh operation möglich? --> left right offset, winkel, stopper height, zscale
[] BuildRoom  - Einheit  --> globalSize overhaul
[] cone radius 2 
    [+] initial implementation in code, and ui
    [] active to settings needs adjustment

after applying
[] remove parents relation ships 
[] generate line of objects (maybe rotatet to the flat parts)

[] label in UI when non scale not zero 

[] Planar connector anwinkeln für leichteren druck und wrench effekt 

[] delete multiple (at least if wrong things are selected) fail

[] global scale value (ist couple size die cubes in single oder die fläche)



[] can a planar cut, comunicate to the following planar that it should cut through all, or does it makes problem in combination with Apply all/parent aply zuordnung ...???????????

bugs:
general operator bug:

[] apply all Problems 
   [] planar last in order it gets moved away and not applied or deleted (also not remains in Mod stack, but is unmapped)
   [] utf8 byte error hard to reproduce

[] single add coup lands away from cursor
[] 90° rotated planar shows Coupscale gizmot problems in analyzer (Stopperheight error)


[] Operator Single to several CenterObj [] ignore mainplaine option
[] reorganize UI 

[] test oversize planar with global scale 
[] gizmot problem fragen

mögliche Probleme
[] Order System update system that stays out of the way 

Tests
[] apply all had a bad day try again 
[] operator descriptions
[] test linux, Mag
[] Active settings with for global scale influence
[] using globalsize
[] move up and down with fremde modifiers 
[]  Special Apply Operator:does modifier remain?

resolved bug:
[+] remap large planar arrays to multiple children of former apply 
[+] bvh overlap missed all modifier settings
[+] apply has problemes with strangers Modifiers 
[+] apply delete other modifiers/booleans after own stack
[+] option keep Connector after apply as unmapped 
[+] planar solidify complex + constrainted looks best
[+] Radius respect Scalefactors
[+] CoupSize Gizmo with absolut values 
[+] inlaysize in add/exchange
[+] test oversize with different globalscale
[+] zScale Active to Setting und Gizmot to setting überarbeiten 
[+] MF sometimes fails (3 Beine Niklas)
[+] plainthickness gizmo
[+] flatcut gizmot
[+] correct oversize to prim for MF
[+] oversize mode devision, update in all functions
[+] cone cylinder gizmos: radius, upper radius,

[+] active to settings not working with order switched on
[+] toogle visibility works toggles main off while inlay gets switched on, check if overlap toggles on or sets visibility
[+] remap active doesn't remap the modifiers
[+] zscale gizmot single scales only the outer inlay when Order active
[+] connector scale factor from active to setting --> negativ
[+] connector scale factor from scale gizmo
[+] planar to single doesnt' transport the coordinates
[+] checker if initialized for gizmos
[+] color planar gizmos
[+] thickness gizmo beschränken und feiner

[+] ********gizmos size absolut or relativ to coup scaling (planar), probaly because not centered but moved.
[+] left right offset gizmos not refreshing position
[+]left right offset gizmos give wrong values back to PUrP
[+] planar scale  gizmos
[+] COUPscale planar for active to setting and add (scale should not be 1 but coup scale )
[+] gizmos einschränkungen (bevelsegment only when beveldistance > .... ) maybe broken when settings in props not updated 
[+] correct from user scale: Single multiply scale of mainplane with the inlays and apply scale to all 
[+] with puzzle not all vertices moving together with zScale gizmo (not the same height?)
[+] planar gizmos thickness (Oversize)
[+] new apply operator: apply Active Planar to several selected objects
[+] new apply operator: apply multiple planar to  active object
