#################feature ideen 

[] Add by tastenkürzel 
[] keep cut out (z.B. größeres Loch schneiden, verbinder rein, extrateil draufkleben um zu schließen, )

    
after applying

[] generate line of objects (maybe rotatet to the flat parts)
[] label in UI when non scale not zero 
[] Planar connector anwinkeln für leichteren druck und wrench effekt 



###############################################################

bugs:
general operator bug:

[?] in setting up oversize, one connector was unmapped (and without signal)

[] add to rotated Cobjects, rotates the connector

[] somehow stick got added without beeing mapped (apply complaints about that but no signal), mapping (parent there but no modifier, when lost?)

[] Godzilla problem: added test for existing parent in remove coupl, but it should be a check before to keep the unmpped   if Coupl.parent != None: verdeckt das und sorgt dafür dass es immer gelöscht wird 

[?] recover produced blend file where initialize is not available --> improve menu über if


[] strong deformed main connector scale gizmo error
Python: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Blender\2.91\scripts\addons\purp\gizmos.py", line 451, in modal

[] test Apply connector designed  
    slide 3 
    puzzle 
    multiple single with multiple objects 
    Cut all option --> crashes at alide 3



Known Issues
[] Apply all will also cut another object when a connector is mapped wrongly too 
[] sometime unmap jumps connector? ground weird parenting ding
[] upper radius cone gizmos weird, radius top 0 produces self overlap --> failure when upper raidus < Oversize, Oversize to prim looks good
[~] active to coup increases Main --> reason remap didn't apply scale before remapping, now its applying but coup scales stil by 1/Centerobj.scale 
[-] cylinder radius should be the diamter (for consistency to cube) or double initial cylinder height  --> changes too much and doesn't matter

New Option
[]? Moving origing to the different pieces?
[] move parts from each other (PUzzle stuff, single schwierig, (bei apply?)
[] shift increase precision of Gizmos
[] create random planar array with random planar parts (with category chooser)


Tests
[] operator descriptions
[] test linux, Mag
[] move up and down with fremde modifiers

resolved bug:
[+] remap operator has problems with remaping visibility (weird unmapped single joint am schwanz)
[+] stick zscale gizmot put panel to zero when coupling is rotated --> uses local matrix now
[+] visibility all error when no coup in the scene
[+] errror in ensure mod when applying defkis --> stick mods where ensured wrongly 
[+] joint exchange when maincut verts change
[+] slide 11 apply all mischfälle wirft errors aus: Error: RuntimeError: Error: ViewLayer 'View Layer' does not contain object 'Cube.003' 
[+] silent "Object was never Cobj before" warning
[+] mainplane needs to be exchanged also when the Connector scale changes
[+] check for renaming, I had a case with .001
[+] apply all should keep connectors which are not overlapping 
  [+] check if apply all respects "keep connector option" 
[+] remap doesn't respect modvisibility setting
[+] planar coupscale gizmot, only updates values after applying (low level problem)
[+] toggle modifier visbility operator poll (limit to active is_coup)object.togglecoupvisibility
[++++] is planar 2 of puzzle correctly mapped when one is applied, two planar makes problems with the second apply (not delted but applied in Order slide)
[???] zScale gizmo single löscht zscale value in panel (shared?)
[+] apply unmapped produces error should produce warning 
[+] planar ui shows radius settings, inlay verts, --> remove please
[+] when check box Add unmapped and exchange makes unmapped signal but its still mapped.

[+] oversize more digits
[+] Buildvolume should not have a gizmo

[+] stopperheight gizmo slower als zscale 
[+] planar connectorscale gizmot does not update panel
[+] linedistance gizmot should be visible when when connector has more than one line (not PUrP properties dependent); same for Bevelgizmos single
[+] Active to setting error when flat flat
[+] rename tool tip gizmos (coupling --> connector)
[ +] single to Multiple: unmapp still moves coupling 
                        mf apply witout ignore works only when mapped to the base? why is that? (Cob flag?)

[+] duplicated planar end up beeing applied in copies too <-- rename function and remap
[~] planar to MulitiObject remove mods from accidental selected SingleCoup inlay -> try and make all of these operator wetterfest
[-] Panel for active object: Linedistance, Line, Modal operators for properties?   
[-] Linedistance must be absolut, otherwise scale changes it
[+] error in "corect name" (ob == none ) when unmapping duplicated planar
[+] Logo2 problem mit normal puzzle apply all, also multi planar to object fails second completly, also the kept coups are moved

[+] I can't delete planar after apply and kept (message: "obj before crash")
[+] order up/down poll
[+] deleted object stayed in Centerobj during add and not the selected
[+] gizmot putting Coupscale to zero
[+] analyse for joint and flat singlemain types
[+] exchange increases size with each ex
[+] single zscale gizmos gives back wrong value back (Defkis)
[+] scale inlay gizmot goes crazy big 
[+] inlay size not reproducing
[+] joint replaced too often
[+] exchanging unmapped planar remaps to Cobj  (not the problem of single)
[+] unmapped signal and exchange problems
[+] add planar unmapped made problems (also centerobj was deleted)
[+] (while cleaning) if i delete obj before deleting the coup, i get an error while deleting the coup
[+]  when user scales mainplaine and then applys scale via --> introduced simple apply(only)Scale funtion
[+] press shift to change smaller increments for gizmot operators
[+] 3D Gizmos!! 

[+] mf fail connector when mainplane turned/transformed --> optimzed side of plane to be independed of connector
[+] add should always ensure scale of 1, otherwise weird position 
[-] exchange should not make a new mainplane, or change it in anyway looks like it doesn't
[+] inlays selectable
[+] refactor order system
[+] adding shouldn't be allowed when PUrP.CObj doesn't exist anymore (check for PUrP.CObj exists, check if PUrP.CObj is coup)
[+] adding unmapped should work with know other object in the scene, 
[+] after apply + keep bevel modifiers lost from inlays
[+] single to multiple: no positiv part when "keep connector" False with ignore and not ignore maincut (working when keep connector True)
 [x] planar last in order it gets moved away and not applied or deleted (also not remains in Mod stack, but is unmapped)
[+] icons visibility
[+] unmap op moves coup

[+] delete multiple (at least if wrong things are selected) fail
[+] delete fails for unmapped
[+] unmap poll: unmapped coups should be possible but ignored, coup + object should apply double 
[+] test oversize planar with global scale 
[+] gizmos movement must scale with global
[+ --> test] globalscale in planar oversize/thicknessclaypoo
[+] apply coup op error when not cut at all (with single stick)
[---] forbid coupling to build plate  -->  seems to be alright
[+] remap unavalable by stick (?) --> poll 
[+] single to multiple objects mf when wrong parent
[+] planar changes rotation, while active to setting 
[+] unmap moves connector to origin
[+] build volume with arrays and options
[+] order must scale with 
[+] exchange should keep the state of visibility
