#################feature ideen 

[] Add by tastenkürzel 
[] keep cut out (z.B. größeres Loch schneiden, verbinder rein, extrateil draufkleben um zu schließen, )

    
after applying
[] remove parents relation ships 
[] generate line of objects (maybe rotatet to the flat parts)

[] label in UI when non scale not zero 

[] Planar connector anwinkeln für leichteren druck und wrench effekt 



[] global scale value (ist couple size die cubes in single oder die fläche)



[] can a planar cut, comunicate to the following planar that it should cut through all, or does it makes problem in combination with Apply all/parent aply zuordnung ...???????????

bugs:
general operator bug:

[] after apply + keep bevel modifiers lost from inlays
[]? Moving origing to the different pieces?
[] single to multiple: no positiv part when "keep connector" False with ignore and not ignore maincut (working when keep connector True)

[] I can't delete planar after apply and kept (message: "obj before crash")
[] Panel for active object: Linedistance, Line, Modal operators for properties?   
[-] Linedistance must be absolut, otherwise scale changes it
[] error in "corect name" (ob == none ) when unmapping duplicated planar
[] Logo2 problem mit normal puzzle apply all, also multi planar to object fails second completly, also the kept coups are moved
[] 

[ ] single to Multiple: unmapp still moves coupling 
                        mf apply witout ignore works only when mapped to the base? why is that? (Cob flag?)

[] duplicated planar end up beeing applied in copies too <-- rename function and remap
[?] depsgraph bvh problem  line 52 bvh, because of noneteype during multiplanar apply
 


[?] apply all Problems 
  
   [?] utf8 byte error hard to reproduce
    [?] apply all --> error cObj in print not found  
    
[] planar to MulitiObject remove mods from accidental selected SingleCoup inlay -> try and make all of these operator wetterfest




Known Issues
[] planar coupscale gizmot, only updates values after applying (low level problem)
[] sometime unmap jumps connector? ground weird parenting ding

New Option
[] move parts from each other (PUzzle stuff, single schwierig, (bei apply?)
[] shift increase precision of Gizmos


Tests
[] operator descriptions
[] test linux, Mag
[] move up and down with fremde modifiers

resolved bug:
 [x] planar last in order it gets moved away and not applied or deleted (also not remains in Mod stack, but is unmapped)
[+] icons visibility
[+] unmap op moves coup
[x] Toggle visibility broken (planar), add/exchange ignores add with/out visibility 
[+] poll functions for all operators 
[+] exchange remaps new planar to a another object when duplicated (duplicate and exchange coupling)
[+] Feature Toggle Viewport Visibility: Toggle Single, Toggle All 
[+] L/ROFfset planar widget moves more than to zero
[+] reorganize UI 
[+] Versioncheck + exact/fast settings   
[+] gizmot problem rausbekommen --> Blender Bug in 2.91 a lot better
[+] single add coup lands away from cursor
[+] delete multiple (at least if wrong things are selected) fail
[+] delete fails for unmapped
[+] unmap poll: unmapped coups should be possible but ignored, coup + object should apply double 
[+] test oversize planar with global scale 
[+] gizmos movement must scale with global
[+ --> test] globalscale in planar oversize/thicknessclaypoo
[+] apply coup op error when not cut at all (with single stick)
[---] forbid coupling to build plate  -->  seems to be alright
[+] remap unavalable by stick (?) --> poll 
[+] single to multiple objects mf when wrong parent
[+] planar changes rotation, while active to setting 
[+] unmap moves connector to origin
[+] build volume with arrays and options
[+] order must scale with 
[+] exchange should keep the state of visibility
[+?] active setting stopper height bool and Height*?*   (add rotated but not rotation applied)
[+?] 90° rotated planar shows Coupscale gizmot problems in analyzer (Stopperheight error)

[+] exchange doesn't respect viewport mod visibility
[+] planar (flat) needs constant linedistance 
[+] Operator Single to several CenterObj [+] ignore mainplaine option
[+]\purp\ui.py", line 135, in draw
    if "BuildVolume" in context.object.name: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'name'
[+] unmappe connector operator
[+] remap large planar arrays to multiple children of former apply 
[+] bvh overlap missed all modifier settings
[+] apply has problemes with strangers Modifiers 
[+] apply delete other modifiers/booleans after own stack
[+] option keep Connector after apply as unmapped 
[+] planar solidify complex + constrainted looks best
[+] Radius respect Scalefactors
[+] CoupSize Gizmo with absolut values 
[+] inlaysize in add/exchange
[+] test oversize with different globalscale
[+] zScale Active to Setting und Gizmot to setting überarbeiten 
[+] MF sometimes fails (3 Beine Niklas)
[+] plainthickness gizmo
[+] flatcut gizmot
[+] correct oversize to prim for MF
[+] oversize mode devision, update in all functions
[+] cone cylinder gizmos: radius, upper radius, 
[+] coupmodedivision context
[+] single oversize gizmot beschränken

[+] active to settings not working with order switched on
[+] toogle visibility works toggles main off while inlay gets switched on, check if overlap toggles on or sets visibility
[+] remap active doesn't remap the modifiers
[+] zscale gizmot single scales only the outer inlay when Order active
[+] connector scale factor from active to setting --> negativ
[+] connector scale factor from scale gizmo
[+] planar to single doesnt' transport the coordinates
[+] checker if initialized for gizmos
[+] color planar gizmos
[+] thickness gizmo beschränken und feiner
[x] exchange multiple couplings broken
[+] ********gizmos size absolut or relativ to coup scaling (planar), probaly because not centered but moved.
[+] left right offset gizmos not refreshing position
[+]left right offset gizmos give wrong values back to PUrP
[+] planar scale  gizmos
[+] COUPscale planar for active to setting and add (scale should not be 1 but coup scale )
[+] gizmos einschränkungen (bevelsegment only when beveldistance > .... ) maybe broken when settings in props not updated 
[+] correct from user scale: Single multiply scale of mainplane with the inlays and apply scale to all 
[+] with puzzle not all vertices moving together with zScale gizmo (not the same height?)
[+] planar gizmos thickness (Oversize)
[+] new apply operator: apply Active Planar to several selected objects
[+] new apply operator: apply multiple planar to  active object
[+] apply all planar ignored 
[+] apply coupling: respect order 
[+] special fall planar schneidet in mehr als 2 teile
[+] apply zuordnung geht gar nicht für male female, aber für stick
[+]flatcut
    [+] implementation
    [+] stopper verbieten oder problem mit gizmos kompensieren
